# Hi, I'm Peter Lee.

I'm familiar with Java, JavaScript and C. For most of the time, I'm working with Java.

I'm interested in studying all kinds of basic libraries, like lossless data compression, data serialization and data extraction.

I'm helping out maintaining Apache Commons Compress, which is an excellent Java library that deals with all kinds of compression.
